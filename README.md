Acceptance Criteria
The OAuth registration process should be secure and user friendly. 
The user should be able to upload, share, like and comment on posts. The user should be able to logout from the platform. 
The platform should be able to handle large volumes of data, handle multiple concurrent users, handle multiple file formats for uploads, different types of media (e.g. images, videos, audio).
The platform should also be able to handle different types of post formats (e.g. text, images, videos), handle different types of comments (e.g. text, images, videos), handle different types of sharing (e.g. text, images, videos) and handle different types of analytics (e.g. user engagement, post performance).
